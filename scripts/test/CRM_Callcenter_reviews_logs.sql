I use an eye cream as I have dark circles and thought I would try a different kind. That was a wrong idea.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received another bottle of each and thought I did n''t order this and I need to return them as I do n''t want either product. Meanwhile, I receive my credit card bill from BankAmericard and notice XXXX different charges which I did not recognize.

She stated she has at least ten calls a day regarding these charges. She knew what I had ordered and went on to tell me to call the number and ask that this be cancelled as they will continue to add charges to the credit card. Evidently there was some terms of services that would give them permission to charge my credit card forever. She went on to advise that if I pressed them, I may be able to get some of my money back. I cancelled my credit card so no further charges could be added. 
I called the first number listed and they had access to both changes so they are the same company. The person stated I had signed up for this on XX/XX/XXXX and said I received the product and did not cancel in 15 days. After explaining I did n''t like the product and did n''t want the product, she agreed to cancel both but could not refund the charges. After calling this a fraud and a scam, she agreed to refund 35 % of the amount charged.

I was not sure if he would actually credit my charge card but just checked with BankAmericard and the amounts were credited to my account. I was on the phone over an hour to get that amount refunded, but they refused to return the whole amount. I plan to pay the balance of {$180.00} as I do not want to ruin my credit or accrue late payments. This was very expensive eye cream.

I used XXXX cards to and gave to him and for me for in game purchases. It would help me catch up to him so I ''d be on the same level so we could play together. When we played, that game had a limit on what you could spend daily and weekly. I do n''t think you could spend XXXX if you wanted. I used XXXX cards mostly. I did use my card on XXXX from time to time. I started playing in XXXX 2015 and quit in XXXX 2015. I would still play the game occasionally but my dad was getting sicker and I only would play when he did. It was the last thing we did together and I ''d do it again if I had to because it was the last way I could spend time with him. After XXXX XXXX is when I quit playing that gameXXXX. I did use XXXX cards and redeem them and I did use my EN card occasionally. But I knew my spending limit. In XXXX when I paid my bill I paid extra like I usually do and I know I had a {$1600.00} credit. So between XXXX and XXXX I knew I used maybe {$400.00} meaning I had {$1200.00} left as credit. From XXXX to XXXX I used maybe {$400.00} again meaning I had around {$800.00} leftover. I called in XXXX and nothing was out of the ordinary. When I called in XXXX, on my birthday, just to verify I still had a credit of about {$800.00} they told me I owed about {$40000.00}. The fraud dept. told that XXXX percent of the time if they go XXXX penny over my limit my card should be turned off and they did n''t have an answer to why it was not turned off. Billing dispute took off all but about {$2000.00}. Then fraud took over and said I had to pay all of the balance. They said the seller had receipts. Any stolen card or compromised card used online and now in stored and restaurants will have receipts because no one checks I.D anymore. I have several phone calls explaining my situation. My history is perfect. Why out if the blue, in my late XXXX would I put XXXX on my card. EN was rude, they laughed at me and refused to help. I talked to Lawyers and they said I should n''t have to pay anything over my limit, I never authorized my limit to the XXXX in the first place. I tried to spend time with my dad before he passed away and I lose XXXX dollars that I never spent. This entire time I still thought I had an {$800.00} credit. XXXX did reimburse me {$2000.00}.', '', 'Consent provided', 'Web', '2017-02-03', 'Closed with explanation', 'Yes', '', 'CR2326338', 'C00000020');

I have called several times and was told mutilple different things about how I could receive my money now that they closed my account that they refuse to reopen. I was told at first that they would reopen the account so I could access my funds after not being able to sign in I called back and was informed that it was n''t even possible to open a closed account and that my money would be send to me at their discretion. So I continued to call hoping to optain my XXXX dollars, when another representative told me to go to the local bank open a new account and they would transfer the money over. I get to the bank they say I am not eligible to get a new account so back to square XXXX. Basically they are holding my money no one know how I can get it or why they even accepted money in an account that they decided to close. Still waiting on a call from there enterprise customer care hoping they will help me but basically everyone on there staff has different information and approximately half of them are so rude it makes me sick to keep trying to contact them about this issue.

I have talked for 3months to Merrill Lynch and have no satisfaction. They have said Legally they have done everything right. They told me government set up this rule to not discuss gains and that is upto me as a consumer to know or ask, so I am out of luck.

After calling customer service multiple times, representatives told me that that my account was put on hold pending fraud reviews. While some holds lasted a week or XXXX, the final " review '''' on my account lasted well over a month. During all this time, I had enough available credit on my account to make any of the purchases I wished to make, and even had a positive balance. 

Half way through XXXX, with a credit on my account, I tried to close the account. The credit card would not be any good to me if I could not make purchases on it for weeks at a time while my account was in review. I was told repeatedly by account reps and supervisors that my account could not be closed while it was in review ( my account had a positive credit because of rewards I had redeemed at this time ). 

In early XXXX, I received a letter explaining that I had " unusual and/or excessive purchases and/or payment transactions '''' and my account had subsequently been closed. No one at EN could explain how what I had done constituted those terms. 

Rather I believe EN saw that it was losing money off me because I had discovered that ( due to XXXX and Target earning 5 % in cash back, where I made purchases ) that I had been an unprofitable customer. In response, they prevented me from using my card ( declining purchases ) and eventually closed my account, because they did not wish to follow the terms and conditions originally agreed too. It is worth noting XXXX and Target are huge and offer almost anything I could need to purchase making it justifiable that a large amount of money could easily be spent there. 

Therefore, EN is performing a bait & switch, holding my money and credit limit ( and sometimes the payment credits on my account ) hostage while they conduct their reviews. Declining my legitimate purchases represents an unlawful action where the company involved does n''t provide limits on a service some people might use more regularly then initially designed. EN offers a 5 % rebate incentive to use their product at certain stores, however, when people actually use the card, EN hides behind fake fraud claims and blocks entire use of the card.Until EN fully discloses any changes to its credit card terms and conditions on the use of the card and any limits involving its rewards categories, then they have no right or reason to block or restrict my legitimate use of the card. EN is only limiting my card usage because they perceived me as spending an ''unusually large '' amount of money in a bonus category and do not wish to honor the 5 % cash back offer they extended to me. 

This ordeal, through no fault of my own, has put a derogatory note on my credit reports, showing that one of my accounts was " closed by issuer. '''' This message reflects negatively on my credit report and could cost me in future transactions I under take with other financial institutions.
